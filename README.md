# Data Structures Class Solutions

This repository contains solutions for assignments from the Sabanci University CS300 Data Structures course, and some other exercises. Each solution is written in C++ and organized in a monorepo structure, allowing centralized management and easy access to multiple assignments.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized with each homework assignment, and project in its own folder:

- `300hw1/` - Solution to the **N-Queens Problem**
- `300hw2/` - Solution to the **Quadtree Search**
- `300hw3/` - Solution to the **Hashmap and Encoding**
- `300hw4/` - Solution to the **Graphs and Maximum Matching**
- `300sorting/` - Implementations of different sorting algorithms.
- `300exercise/` - My personal exercise codes for studying data structures.
